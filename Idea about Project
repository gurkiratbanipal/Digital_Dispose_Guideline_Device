Introduction:

Canada is the nation of immigrants. People come here from different countries. As every nation have their own rules and
regulation, their way to deal with waste are also different. So, when they commute to Canada, they are unaware of waste 
sorting plan in Canadian community. A research shows that each year Canada is producing nearly 31 million tones of garbage,
and among all the other country’s waste per capita of the world this is highest. Along with reducing the amount of waste 
Canadian waste management also imposing the idea of sorting of waste, so people are provided with multiple coloured bins 
to put waste according to type of material. But because of lack of awareness individuals are unable to meet the expectation
of waste management community.
  
Although municipal communities are putting efforts to solve this problem by assigning volunteer and providing booklets to
each and every house yearly, so that each person can read and understand about the way they are supposed to deal with the
different types of garbage. But the idea of providing booklets to citizens is not that successful as today’s hectic 
schedules had left with no time for people to read those booklets and understand about managing with different types of
wastages. People don’t go through all the contents provided in the waste management book, so they didn’t get enough 
knowledge and ends up throwing recyclable stuff in garbage after scratching their heads for a while. Ultimately, all
the garbage including recyclable stuff goes to landfill, which leads to produce large amount of methane that contributes
to greenhouse gasses more than emission of carbon dioxide. Also, sometimes individuals threw garbage stuff into recycle 
bins or kitchen waste bins that requires tough sorting in the end. This action not only effects environment but money and
resources too, as municipalities spend huge amount of money to handle these wastes. 

In this era of technology, we are surrounded with smart gadgets all around. But unfortunately, we do not have any gadget 
that can provide us information about sorting of garbage, recycle and kitchen waste stuff. Even though we are in 21st century
but for this specific thing people are still dependent on those conventional way of using paper books to get information about
different kind of wastes which are delivered to each house every year by the waste management departments. So, we decided to 
make a digital device that will get rid of those paper books, the “Smart waste management device” that will help people to get
information about sorting of different kind of waste. This device will help people to put the garbage according to the assigned
bins in a smart digital way rather than going through those long community waste management books. Therefore, there will be 
less amount of waste to pickup and by this way municipalities can save money as they don’t have to sort that garbage from the
recycle waste stuff and vice versa. 

Thus, this idea of using smart waste management device is going to be more easy and benificial for both people and municipal
corporations. Also, we will be making our environment safe and healthy by so many ways like we will be saving a lot of paper
as we do not those heavy and long traditional books.

Description

The Smart waste management device will be a digital copy that will consist community waste management guidelines and will 
guide user digitally about the different types of stuff and in which bin that particular stuff has to go after being used 
by the person.
So, this device will consist of a processor that will be a Beaglebone black in this case and the user will be interacting 
with the device by a touch screen that will be a 7-inch touch display. Beaglebone black will be connected with the 7-inch 
LCD screen through the GPIO pins and LCD cape. The LCD cape will connect to beaglebone black like a shield over the GPIO 
pins. The beaglebone will be loaded with the latest image through a SD card. Also, beaglebone black will be connected with
a wi-fi adapter that will provide the internet connection to the beaglebone black.
The Newhaven Display 7" Beaglebone Capes are specifically designed for the Beaglebone Black boards. The product line features
three capes, each mounted to either a standard, premium, or sunlight-readable 7" Newhaven Display TFT.
Components required:
    1) Beaglebone black
    2) Newhaven 7-inch LCD Cape
    3) Wi-fi adapter
    4) SD card
    5) 5V power supply adapter

Procedure:

First of all, the beaglebone black has to be loaded with the latest image which can be done by following ways:
We have two versions available: 1. Run image directly from Micro Sd card
    • Firstly, we will download the image file. This should be in the format of BBB-eMMC-flasher-distro-year.month.day.img.xz.
    • After successfully extracting the .xz file, insert the micro Sd card in computer and start disk image tool. It should be
      with storage capacity of 4GB or higher.
    • Our computer will not detect the SD card if we start disk image tool before inserting SD card.
    • In linux, balenaEtcher helps to write the .img file to Sd card. The time for this task will vary according to speed of
      writer and card and the type of distribution. 
    • At the end we will have a micro Sd card with image to flash eMMc of BBB.
2. Writing flasher image to on board eMMc of Beaglebone black
    • For this version we need a Sd card with Flasher Linux image.
    • Power of BBB by just disconnecting USB of 5V power supply and insert the micro Sd card in the slot.
    • On the top right of BBB, there is button for booting, hold it and connect BBB with USB for power.
    • Don’t release the button till the LEDs start flashing. These LEDs should flash in sequence for 5-25 mins.
    • Disconnect the power supply and restart BBB with S2 button.
    • Don’t forget to remove the SD card from BBB.
    • Lastly press S3 button to power on board, there you will see the latest image.
    
After uploading the latest image to the beaglebone black the next step is to connect the beaglebone with the 7-inch LCD Cape.
This could be done by connecting the beaglebone GPIO pins to the pins of LCD cape. Both beaglebone and LCD cape had equal 
number of pins and are designed to be connected to each other. The layout of pins is same on both beaglebone and LCD screen
so connecting LCD cape will be same as we connect a shield device to the beaglebone.
Once the beaglebone and 7-inch LCD cape are connected physically, then next step is to connect both of these devices through
drivers and make them interact with each other. This could be done by following ways:
Here we are using a capacitive touch display, so we need to use graphical interface as this doesn’t work in the command line
directly. For activating graphical interface, we will use Linux command line text editors and make some modifications to 
the/boot/uEnv.txt file. VI, Vim and Nano.
Following command will be used for command line text editor, Nano.
    • Sudo nano/boot/uEnv.txt - to open the file which we are going to edit.
    • Sudo cp/boot/uEnv-Backup.txt - to create the backup of file before editing.
Disable the HDMI interface that can interfere with some pins to LCD cape. To do so we will change the following lines in 
uNv.txt file-
## Beaglebone Black dtb’s for v4.1.x
## Beaglebone Black: HDMI(Audio/Video) disabled:
dtb=am335x-boneblack-emmc-overlay.dtb
## Beaglebone Black: eMMC disabled:
dtb=am335x-boneblack-hdmi-overlay.dtb
## Beaglebone Black: HDMI Audio/eMMC disabled:
dtb=am335x-boneblack-nhdmi-overlay.dtb
## Beaglebone Black: HDMI (Audio/Video)/eMMC disabled:
dtb=am335x-boneblack-overlay.dtb
## Beaglebone Black: wl1835
dtb=am335x-boneblack-wl1835mod.dtb
## Beaglebone Black:replicape
dtb=am335x-boneblack- replicape.dtb

When the beaglebone and LCD get connected to each other the next step is to connect the beaglebone to the internet. This will
be done by connecting a wi-fi adapter to the beaglebone. Once the adapter is connected physically then we have to get the 
internet working over beaglebone, which will be done by following steps:
    • First of all, login as root in the terminal window.
    • To see the status of wireless connection, type 
#connmanctl technologies
The status for Bluetooth, p2p and Wi-Fi will pop up as in following image-

    • In root write #connmanctl  
    • To get Wi-Fi working write the command
connmanctl > enable wifi
connmanctl > scan wifi
    • To see the available networks and connecting with one of the use- 
connmanctl > services
connmanctl >agent on
connmanctl >connect (enter the value of network to which we are going to connect)
    • For configuring IP address 
connmanctl >config (value of network same as above) --ipv4 manual(specify IP address for BBB) (write netmask) (IP address of 
router) – name server 8.8.8.8
    • quit from here and write #ping www.google.com to see if it is working.

Sending text messages through the beaglenbone internet to the mobiole phone. This will be done through following steps:

We will write a node.js program for web interfacing. In our Beagle bone black we will use apache server to serve web services 
on board. Node.js will be constantly connected with web page provided with an interactive web page through web socket.
