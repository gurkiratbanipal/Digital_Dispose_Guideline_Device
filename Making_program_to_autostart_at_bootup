#autostart

When whole program is ready our next goal is to make the program to execute automatically whenever raspberry boots up.
To do this we first made one file which will execute our diffrent source and header files.
Next, this file was moved to root directory of raspberry pi 4.

Then, browse to directory:
/home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi

created a file "autostart"

Added this data into it-
@lxpanel --profile LXDE-pi
@pcmanfm --desktop --profile LXDE-pi
@xscreensaver -no-splash
@point-rpi

@/home/pi/DigDisGUI       // Location of file to be executed
