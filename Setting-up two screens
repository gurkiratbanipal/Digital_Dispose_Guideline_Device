#Process to run two HDMI LCD Screens using Raspberry Pi4

#At the begining, we have used only one screen during the insallation of Resbian Operating System adn then did few experiments to make our project and display over screen.
While in our project we are going to use two screens so, our next step was to get both the screens running simultaneously.

Steps to connect two screen to Raspberry pi4:

1. First one Screen is connected to Raspberry pi4's microHDMI Port0 through a microHDMi to HDMI cable.

2. Then second Screen is connected to Raspberry pi4's microHDMI Port1 through a microHDMi to HDMI cable.

3. Both screen are connected to power supply.

4. Then a microSD card with a raspbian image is conneceted to raspberry pi microSD card slot.

5. Then Power supply is connected to raspberry pi 4.

6. Raspberry will start booting up.
    (Its important to connect both screens while booting up.)
