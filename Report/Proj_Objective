In this era of technology, we are surrounded with smart gadgets all around us. 
But unfortunately, we do not have any gadget that can provide us information about 
sorting of garbage, recycle and kitchen waste stuff. Even though we are in 21st century 
but for this specific thing people are still dependent on
 those conventional way of using paper books to get information about different 
kind of wastes which are delivered to each house every year by the waste management departments.
