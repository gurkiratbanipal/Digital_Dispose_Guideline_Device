#Objective
In this era of technology, we are surrounded with smart gadgets all around us. 
But unfortunately, we do not have any gadget that can provide us information about 
sorting of garbage, recycle and kitchen waste stuff. Even though we are in 21st century 
but for this specific thing people are still dependent on
 those conventional way of using paper books to get information about different 
kind of wastes which are delivered to each house every year by the waste management departments.



 So, we decided to make a digital device that will get rid of those paper books, the “Smart waste management device” that will help people 
 to get information about sorting of different kind of waste. This device will help people to 
put the garbage according to the assigned bins in a smart digital way rather than going through those long community
waste management book. Therefore, there will be less amount of waste to pickup and by this way municipalities can save 
money as they don’t have to sort that garbage from the recycle waste stuff and vice versa.
