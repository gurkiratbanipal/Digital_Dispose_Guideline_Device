1.Unavoidable Facts-
Canada is the nation of immigrants. People come here from different countries. As every nation have their
own rules and regulation, their way to deal with waste are also different. So, when they commute to Canada,
they are unaware of waste sorting plan in Canadian community. A research shows that each year Canada is
producing nearly 31 million tones of garbage, and among all the other countryâ€™s waste per capita of the
world this is highest. Along with reducing the amount of waste Canadian waste management also imposing the
idea of sorting of waste, so people are provided with multiple coloured bins to put waste according to type
of material. But because of lack of awareness individuals are unable to meet the expectation of waste 
management community.
