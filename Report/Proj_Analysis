Analysis

During the analyzing process, we were planning to make it somewhat different from mobile phones and laptops. 
So, there was the competition as although people like to use smart devices but they prefer those which are 
easy to handle because majority of them are portable and with simple user interface and advanced Micro-controller Unit.
So, this thing took us to the decision that our project will have touch screen display. Besides, this point of using 
touch screen lead us making this device eye-catching by using two 7‚Äù HDMI touch Displays and bind them together so that 
it will look like a book.Because the outer appearance is the first thing which mesmerize the user to reach an item for
exploring further.

In addition to this, we have searched about the latest MCU that have all the powerful features like modern computers. 
Raspberry Pi 4 was the best option among all others. This Board have two inbuilt HDMI ports for connecting two output 
devices parallelly. Last but not the least, our MCU and output displays are going to take power input from rechargeable 
battery, that will make it portable.
