Our plan after deciding to use two screens was to display book manual on one screen and display 2-3 diffrent options
on the second screen from which user can select one and go on with whatever user select.

Three options we decided were:
1. Calender for waste collection
2. Quiz
3. Mobile texting


So, when we started working on the software for the project,
Our first aproach was use of Visual studio C# application
We worked for around 2 weeks on it but as the program was builting in c sharp language we drop off the idea.

Our second approach was using eclipse and using crosstoolchain 
We worked approximately 2 weeks on this.
But we faced few problems in using this method like we needed a keyboard while output.
Also, output was not graphical.

Then we approached QT
We worked for around 3 weeks on this approach.
Through this we got output on both the screens as we had planned.
We successfully displayed book manual on one screen and few diffrent options on the second screen from which
user can select whichever user wants to open.
