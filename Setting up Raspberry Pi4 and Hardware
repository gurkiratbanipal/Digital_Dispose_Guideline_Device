## Steps to set-up Raspberri pi

1. First of all, we formatted our SD card using SD card formatter tool, that can be download from sdcard.org.

2. To install Raspberry Pi Operating system, we used NOOBS (New out of box system). This is available on Raspberrpi.org. Downloaded file
   was in zip format so we first uncompressed the file and then copy all the files from uncompressed file to SD card. Thus, our Sd card 
   was prepared to use to install Raspberry Pi operating system.
   
3. After inserting the micro SD card to raspberry Pi 4’s SD card socket.

4. When we checked all the connections (power supply to Raspberry Pi, R pi to mouse, keyboard and HDMI), it’s the time to start R pi,
   it took a little to start the screen, then a dialog box of NOOBS installer appeared. It gave us two options from which we selected 
   install Raspbian. 
   
5. When the installation was done, we clicked ok to reboot and load the Raspbian Operating system.

6. Then we selected the time zone and preferred language.

7. Choose the Wi-Fi network which we are going to use and entered the password to use the internet service on raspberry pi.

8. As, we are using a touchscreen display for our project, we set up the virtual keyboard in this, so that we don’t need 
   the USB keyboard anymore. To do this we have used following commands in Terminal window of Raspberry Pi-
   -sudo apt-get update
   -sudo apt-get upgrade
   -sudo apt-get install matchbox-keyboard
   -sudo reboot
     We assed the virtual keyboard from Menu-Accessories-Keyboard.

9. We did some change in appearance of home screen but these were optional. :-)
